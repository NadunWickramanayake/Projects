			The home of our surf camp The Surfer Sri Lanka - Weligama was once just another sleepy coastal town, now is widely known as one of the Sri Lanka best beginner surf destinations.
			And hey - it's not only best surf for beginners.<br></br>
			As Weligama located perfectly in the middle of all the best surf breaks Sri Lanka has to offer on the southwest, there are plenty of nearby reefs and point breaks for intermediates.

		<p  style="font-family:'Caveat'; font-size:30px;  padding:50px;" >

			Knuckles Mountain Range or the Knuckles Massif is part of the Hill Country of Sri Lanka which is also above 3000 Ft or 915 Mts. from sea level and covers an area of about 90 Sq.Miles or 234 Sq.Km of land extent. This is also called as Knuckles Range or Knuckles Peaks or simply as Knuckles. The reason to call it Knuckles is because,there is a mountain with five peaks in itself, that looks like the knuckles of a clenched fist when seen from Kandy area ( or the SW direction of that mountain named as Knuckles with a height of 6112 Feet ). The Sri Lankan name for this mountainous area is " Dumbara Mitiyawatha " which means " The Misty Vally ". Since this inner mountainous area is off the motoring roads, it remains as an unspoilt nature reserve even today. Knuckles Mountain Range is considered as the most spectacular mountain scenic landscape of Sri Lanka's highland. The best view points of Knuckles mountain range are from Corbet's Gap and from Laggala Patana where there is a mini Worlds End.

			Sigiriya, also called Lion Rock or Lion Mountain, site in central Sri Lanka consisting of the ruins of an ancient stronghold that was built in the late 5th century CE on a remarkable monolithic rock pillar. The rock, which is so steep that its top overhangs the sides, rises to an elevation of 1,144 feet (349 metres) above sea level and is some 600 feet (180 metres) above the surrounding plain.
			<br></br>
			The Sinhalese king Kashyapa I (reigned 477–495) built a palace in the shape of a monumental lion on the several acres of ground at the summit, intending it to be a safeguard against his enemies. However, the king was defeated in 495, and the palace fell into ruin. The site soon became a pilgrimage destination, however, and it is now a popular tourist spot. Visitors begin the final ascent to the top through the open paws of the lion, one of the few remaining portions of the palace that are still intact. Also notable are 21 rock paintings of apsaras (celestial singers and dancers). Sigiriya was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1982.

			Ella Rock is one of the most beautiful viewpoints in Sri Lanka. When we arrived in Ella we knew we wanted to do some hiking, and as soon as we saw photos of Ella Rock we knew had to hike it.<br></br>
			However Ella Rock isn’t a very easy hike to do, mainly because of the lack of clear directions indicating the trail. We hiked Ella Rock without a guide by following the instructions our hostel gave us, but it was still a challenge.<br></br>
			Our second hike in Ella was to Little Adam`s Peak, which we did in between the two longer ones. We did this trip without a guide. It is a fairly easy hike and the path is marked by signs so it`s easy to find, and very popular among tourists! So expect to meet many other people from all over the world on this trip! On the two other more remote trips we did in Ella, we hardly met anybody, just some locals now and then.

			The Horton Plains plateau comes to a sudden end at World’s End, a stunning escarpment that plunges 880m. The walk here is 4km, but the trail then loops back to Baker’s Falls (2km) and continues back to the entrance (another 3.5km). The 9.5km round trip takes a leisurely three hours. Unless you get there early, the view from World’s End is often obscured by mist, particularly during the rainy season from April to September.<br></br>
			All you can expect to see from World’s End after around 9am is a swirling white wall. The early morning (between 6am and 10am) is the best time to visit, before the clouds roll in. That’s when you’ll spy toy-town, tea-plantation villages in the valley below, and an unencumbered view south towards the coast.<br></br>
			A famous waterfall in Sri Lanka, Baker’s Falls sits between the entrance and World’s End gap of Horton Plains national park. Named after the British explorer Sir Samuel Baker, it is not a tall waterfall but is extremely beautiful which gives stunning views at different angles.

Far from the fast-paced modernisation of India and her huge cities, Sri Lanka is a microcosm of diversity – palm-fringed beaches, ancient Buddhist cities, verdant tea plantations and lush national parks are amongst her many highlights.  Our job, is to combine these highlights to provide a Sri Lanka safari holiday that perfectly blends these into one unforgettable adventure.

			The Yala National Park is among the oldest and best known of Sri Lanka's 15 National Parks. It covers approximately 1,300 square kilometres and is home to a range of ecosystems found nowhere else in Sri Lanka. With vegetation including moist and dry monsoon forests, thorn forest, savannah grasslands and fresh and saltwater wetlands, it comes as no surprise that the Yala National Park has the perfect habitats for the large number of endemic plant and animal species unique to the country, thus making it one of the chosen wildlife safari destinations that features on everyone’s tour itineraries. There are 44 species of recorded mammals in this National Park, which include the Sri Lankan Leopard, Sri Lankan Sloth Bear and Sri Lankan Elephant, 215 species of birds, 46 species of reptiles and 21 species of amphibians.

			The Udawalawe National Park is famed for its resident population of Sri Lankan elephants (a recognised subspecies of its Asian counterpart), and it is not unusual to see herds gather to feed and bathe at the waterholes while on even the shortest of safaris at the Udawalawe National Park. With approximately 600 to 700 Sri Lankan elephants residing within the confines of this wildlife park, it is an amazing and unforgettable experience to witness these elephants, both adults and young in their natural habitat. The August 2011 census of elephants in Sri Lanka stated that there are approximately 5,800 of these culturally important animals living on the island. The Sri Lankan Elephant is a threatened species.

			Wasgamuwa National Park is located approximately 50km northeast of Kandy in the Polonnaruwa and Matale Districts of Sri Lanka. The park is isolated by large rivers on all but its southern boundary and dominated by the Sudukanda Mountain Range, which runs from north to south between the Amban Ganga and Mahaweli Ganga rivers. With just over 39,000 hectares, the park is contiguous with the Riverine Nature reserve on the right bank of the Mahaweli Ganga.
			<br></br>
			An important centre of ancient Sri Lankan culture, Wasgamuwa National Park has been left off-the-beaten-track for a number of years but is now gaining in popularity once more.
			<br></br>
			The park was originally designated a game sanctuary in 1907 and then upgraded to a Strict Nature Reserve in 1938. After a period of accelerated clearing from the Mahaweli Development Project, which deprived the wildlife of its habitat, the Wasgamuwa National Park Strict Nature Reserve and a neighbouring piece of land were brought together into one unit and given National Park status on 7 August 1984 in an effort towards the conservation of biodiversity. The vegetation here is tropical dry mixed evergreen forest, with trees such as the weera, wa and endemic kaluwara ebony present. Hilly ridges of the park are covered in dense forests, as are the banks of the major rivers.  Dense forests characterise the park; however, there are extensive open plains in the south-eastern and eastern parts of the park dominated by grass illuk.

Sinharaja is bounded by rivers on three sides. On the north, Sinharaja is bounded by the Napola Dola and Koskulana Ganga. On the south and south-west are the rivers Maha Dola and Gin Ganga. On the west are the river Kalukandawa Ela and river Kudawa Ganga. To the east of Sinharaja is an ancient footpath near Beverley Tea Estate and by the Denuwa Kanda..

			The Kalpitiya peninsula, just north of Chilaw, is brimming with beaches, lagoons and historic buildings. Whale sightings have only become more prominent in the past ten years or so, with sperm whales diving down to try their luck at catching a giant squid. If you’re lucky, there’s a chance you might see a magnificent blue whale, too.
			<br></br>
			The majority of hotels, camps and guesthouses in Kalpitiya can easily arrange whale-watching tours for guests. Most trips start at sunrise and can last up to three hours. The best time to visit is outside of the monsoon season, when the sea should be at its calmest.
